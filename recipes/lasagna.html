                        <li><strong>Tomato products:</strong>You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce,<br> and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong>Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the<br> flavor of the sauce.</li>
                        <li><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong>This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley,<br> dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong>Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cheeses:</strong>Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
                        <li><strong>Egg:</strong>An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when<br> you cut into it.</li>
